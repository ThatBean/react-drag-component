# react-drag-component

Odd Packages Packed Within(currently):
* `react-context-store` for using react context
* `state-scheme` for Immutable Data
* `hammerjs` for Event processing

#### Hack guide

To use this package is not (that) simple.

First check the [DEMO](https://thatbean.github.io/react-drag-component/) code located at `example/`

Then try to hack the React Component code at `example/source`. The CSS style is `postcss-cssnext` format.

The state related code is at:
* `source/`
* `example/source/index`

The Pointer Event related code is at: `source\__lib__\eventControl`
